# Website-Clone-1
I made this clone to enhance my skills at core CSS.<br>
In the the whole clone no bootstrap or any other framework is used.

## Links
Link to the original Website https://biznus-template.webflow.io/<br>
Link to my website https://udit512.github.io/Website-Clone-1/<br>
If my link is not working then I would have removed it.

## How to view the website

```
$ git clone https://github.com/udit512/Website-Clone-1.git
$ npm install -g live-server
```
Go to the directory which contains the index.html file and run the following command
```
$ live-server
```
A browser window with the website will pop up
